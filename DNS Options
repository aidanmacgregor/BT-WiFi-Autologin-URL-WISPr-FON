#There are 3 DNS Options
1. Under DHCP settings in the field "DHCP-Options" with something like 6,192.168.1.15 (for Google DNS & PiHole, for example).
2. Or putting this in the field called "Use custom DNS servers" in the Interface settings under Common Configuration
3. Or under DHCP and DNS settings in the DNS Forwardings field

#The Diffrences
1. tells DHCP clients to use the specified NS instead of the router
2. tells OpenWrt to ignore upstream (ISP) DNS servers and hardcodes custom ones. Clients will go through OpenWrt's DNS cache
3. Is rather intented to forward specific domains to specific NS servers, to implement some kind of "DNS routing", e.g. resolve company intranet domains via a different NS only reachable via VPN without having to direct all queries to it.
